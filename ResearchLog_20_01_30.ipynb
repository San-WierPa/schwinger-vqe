    "- Concatenating kets is of course $\\neq$ to concatenating qubits. For a 2-spatial-site system, joining an even and and odd parity sector requires just one more qubit (the Hilbert space is twice as large). And I can write down the superposition circuit from before with this many qubits.\n",

    "- Using code from Mathematica, I can, having defined variational-basis operators in the MC computational basis, use my explicit map to the QC basis to evalute the numerical form of each operator element-by-element: $\\langle n | O | m \\rangle$. I've done so for the case of a 2-spatial site system, where I can fit 3 operators.\n",
