    "- Play around in Mathematica to see what kind of optimization I get if I optimize over probabalities, not amplitudes. What changes if I express my variational basis operators in terms of the Pauli basis (so that I get non-zero imaginary parts in corresponding amplitudes?)\n",
    "- Looking at old code, my optimization (over amplitudes) was computed with a Monte-Carlo computational basis (spins / fermions), not the basis of the even/odd parity sectors. Which is of course irrelevant for the amplitudes, but is important as I start looking at probabilities (function ```extractCoeffs```)\n",
    "- The coefficients for the VQ basis are given by ```gsCoeffs``` (ground state), ```eEvenPCoeffs``` (even-parity excited states), and ```eOddPCoeffs``` (odd-parity excited states), while the basis vectors themselves are in ```varBasis1``` and ```varBasis2```, respectively.\n",

    "is not immediately accessible: we don't actually have the state $| \\widetilde{V}^-,\\,\\vec{\\theta}^\\prime \\rangle$ on the computer. Since the pauli strings are unitary, we can measure things like $| \\langle \\phi_a | \\hat{B}_s | \\Omega,\\, \\vec{\\theta} \\rangle |^2$. I do not know how to infer the probability for a linear combination of these strings from here, I am missing all the interference terms.\n",
    "- So, even though I could go ahead and concoct, in Mathematica, $| \\langle \\phi_a | \\widetilde{V}^-,\\,\\vec{\\theta}^\\prime \\rangle |^2$, I don't know how we would do that on the quantum side.\n",
    "\n",
    "On another note, although I still don't know how to measure the imaginary part of an amplitude directly, I know I can measure the square of the off-diagonoal amplitude for a unitary operator (e.g. Pauli string). From those two I can figure out the imaginary part up to a sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Scott's trick, just rotate both qubits by $\\exp{-i \\pi/4}$ and ditto to get the imaginary part of the amplitude? **No, just do the same thing for $-i$ times the operator. This gets the operator's imaginary part.**  "

A block with two ends which connect to the rest of the system must respond to nearly independent fluctuations near each of the ends. In the case of a long block, where the ends are nearly independent, if m states are required to accurately describe a single end to a given accuracy, then approximately $m$ states would be required to accurately represent both ends. In other words, if for a given accuracy open boundary condition require $m$ states, periodic boundary conditions require roughly $m^2$ states.\"\n",
