# schwinger-vqe
VQE simulation of the Schwinger model with Qiskit

VQE Calculations

- savage.ipynb is the original Jupyter notebook used to play with VQE workflow. It uses Qiskit minimally, so that all the different parts are
explicit and verbose. This may be helpful when trying to understand what
Qiskit does behind the scenes.
- VQE.ipynb is the main notebook for a VQE simulations. Still in development. 
Ultimately, this needs be a Python module/package.
But the current Jupyter-notebook form is convenient for playing around with the code and learning Qiskit's functionality. 
Different parts of the VQE workflow have smaller notebooks. They're not required to run the main one, 
but are convenient if you want to look at an isolated element of the simulation.
- Superposition.ipynb is the Jupyter with a circuit for producing a superposition of the variational states (ground state and first excited state)

Mathematica code (exact diagonalization)

- savage.nb is the main notebook that performs projection onto
zero-momentum sector, truncation, and splits the resulting Hilbert space
into even and odd parity sectors. It diagonalizes the corresponding Hamiltonians,
expresses the eigenstates in the computational basis of the QC
simulation. Interpolating operators are constructed and exact effective
mass curves are computed. 
- variational_layer.nb is a notebook to play
with the form of the variational layer in the QC simulation as an
explicit unitary. 
- operators.nb is a notebook where the numerical matrix
form of the interpolators is computed in the (concatenated) QC
computational basis of even and odd parity sectors.
