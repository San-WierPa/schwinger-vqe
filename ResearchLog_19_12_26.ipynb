    "- [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.0411.pdf), among other things, proposes the algorithm of supervised cluster assignment, where in particular there is a description of measuring an inner product between two vectors. Need to work through and understand. One thing to note is that it ties together what Natalie mentioned and what Scott and I discussed. So it's probably not two distrinct methods.\n",

    "- [Lloyd's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.0411.pdf) shows that people have thought about the object we want to compute a while ago, motivated  by data analysis / big data. \n",
    "- A swap test circuit, which is a part of those proposed algorithms and other [notable papers](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.167902), indeed allows to measure just a single number â€” the *square* of the inner product between two vectors. \n",
    "- If we are to employ a swap-test-like approach, in the language of the data-analysis paper, we additionally want to post-process our vector with a transition operator. This means, **actually apply the transition operator**, which in practice will require ancillary qubits, and which is something we'd like to avoid (right?). In the other hand, if we measure the inner product between the ground state and the first excited state in the Schwinger model, we will of course just get 0.\n",
    "- So, staring at what is currently now Eq.(II.7) on Overleaf, I want to actually measure the matrix elements, and then combine them to form the variational operators. This avoid applying a non-unitary operator to a state, and is more feasible at the moment."
